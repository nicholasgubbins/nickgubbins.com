Brexit has brought the UK political climate, and the Imperial legacy to an apotheosis. For the first time, the U.K, the superpower of yesteryear, is empirically fading into the middle tier of nations. 

Our economy is dependent on legacy business. BP, HSBC, British American Tobacco, Unilever - all businesses that were ground breaking in their day, but dated. We aren't forging a path into the 21st century, and when these are the companies that our educated can aspire to work out, so the culture becomes one of legacy and not of future looking optimism.

This emphasis on legacy is no more apparent than in our political system, and ruling classes. 

The political structures, that of monarchy, of aristocracy, of unelected, hereditary peers, show that aspiration is futile. You can work until your face is blue, but not your blood. 

So what do I propose? At such a critical time in the UK, my proposal is fairly sweeping, likely popular. 

1. Replace the lords with an elected body. 
2. Replace the hereditary inheritance of the monarch and replace with a fully randomised lifetime position. The role will remain purely ceremonial, and nominally will be a monarch
